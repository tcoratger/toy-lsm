/// Command represents an operation on the database (Set or Remove).
///
/// ### Why Store Commands Instead of Raw Data?
///
/// When working with in-memory tables (MemTable), a key design decision is whether to store
/// raw data directly or to store commands (like Set and Remove). This choice impacts how
/// smoothly and consistently we can transition data between in-memory tables and on-disk
/// storage (SSTable).
///
/// #### The Problem
///
/// Consider a scenario where a memory table reaches its capacity and needs to be persisted
/// to disk. This process can be simple if we temporarily stop all write operations. However,
/// if we want to allow read/write operations to continue uninterrupted, we face a challenge.
///
/// A common solution is to create a new memory table, say `B`, while persisting the old table,
/// `A`, to disk. At this point, `A` becomes read-only, and all new write operations are directed
/// to `B`. The challenge arises when you need to handle operations across these tables:
///
/// - **Get Request**: when reading a value, you first check `B`, then `A`, and finally the SSTable
///   on disk if necessary.
/// - **Set Request**: new data is written directly to `B`.
/// - **Remove (RM) Request**: if a key to be deleted exists only in `A`, which is now read-only,
///   you cannot directly remove it from `A`. However, by storing the RM command in `B`, the system
///   can effectively register the deletion, ensuring that even though `A` is read-only, the key is
///   considered deleted when checking `B`.
///
/// #### The Solution
///
/// By storing commands like Set and Remove in the memory table instead of just raw data, we can
/// ensure that operations are handled correctly, even when transitioning between memory tables.
/// This approach allows us to maintain consistency and support ongoing read/write operations
/// without interruption.

/// `LSMDatabase` is a key-value store that manages in-memory and on-disk storage using
/// the Log-Structured Merge-Tree (LSM-Tree) model.
///
/// ### Components:
/// - **MemTable**: the in-memory table where all new write operations (set and remove)
///   are initially stored. It serves as the first layer of data storage.
/// - **SSTables**: a series of immutable, on-disk tables where the data from the MemTable
///   is persisted once the MemTable reaches a certain size. These SSTables are used for
///   reading data when it is no longer in the MemTable.
/// - **memtable_threshold**: this defines the maximum size the MemTable can reach before
///   it is flushed to disk and converted into a new SSTable. This threshold helps in
///   managing memory usage and ensuring efficient persistence.
/// - **next_sstable_id**: a counter used to assign unique IDs to each new SSTable as it
///   is created. This helps in organizing and identifying SSTables over time.
///
/// ### How it Works:
/// The LSM-Tree model is designed to efficiently handle both write and read operations.
/// - **Writes**: new entries are first written to the MemTable. When the MemTable reaches
///   its threshold size, it is flushed to disk as an SSTable, ensuring that the in-memory
///   data is persisted and the memory is freed up for new data.
/// - **Reads**: data retrieval happens by first checking the MemTable (the most recent
///   data), then moving through the SSTables in reverse chronological order until the
///   desired key is found or all sources have been exhausted.
///
/// This structure ensures that writes are fast and that reads are efficient even as the
/// database grows.
